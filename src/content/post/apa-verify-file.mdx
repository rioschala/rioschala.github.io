## Why Using APA or IEEE Style Format?

During the creation of your extended essay, it's essential that you submit and create a clear and up-to-date reseach project. This cannot be only done by researching or developing your topics.

Instead, it is fundamental that we get to follow a pre-defined set of rules that affect your final version of the document. This parameters must be adjusted, specially, for a **better readability** and a **better structure**.

In the next sections, you will find a series of tasks that you must perform on your document so that it gets adjusted to APA[^1] 7th edition. **Tick** the box if you followed the suggestion (Doing so leads to a better EE).

**These are only suggestions. You can follow other formatting styles such as IEEE**.
