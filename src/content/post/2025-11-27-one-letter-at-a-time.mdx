# Early days

The earliest time I can track in my mind of myself reading gets to my school library, checking one comic of The Adventures of TinTin^1. During that time, of course it was clear to me that reading was a fundamental skill not only to learn, but also to have fun. I still ask myself where that feeling went to since years later I found extremely difficult to even focus while reading a small passage.
