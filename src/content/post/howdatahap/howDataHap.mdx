Having moved dramatically away from its qualitative roots, the term “statistics” came to incorporate, on the one hand, the accumulation of data, primarily numerical data, about everything from people to climate, and on the other hand, a set of powerful, beguiling, and often misused mathematical tools to draw conclusions and analyze data.18

Statistics doesn’t simply represent the world. It transforms how we categorize and view the world. It transforms how we categorize others and ourselves. It changes the world. And, as we’ll see, contemporary data science does this—at hyperspeed.
