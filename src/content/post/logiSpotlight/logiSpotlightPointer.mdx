## What is it?
The Logi Spotlight is a clicker, pointer, presentation controller with a slick design, three clickable buttons and multiple personalization options. All these tools are designed for a specific public in mind: academics, speakers, teachers and whoever needs a device to control any presentation. 

All this information resembles an infomertial that can be created by any tech influencer, but despite its commercial advantages, I for one can tell that it is the most advanced and complete gadget in that field that can offer a different set of options rather than just being an external keyboard. 

I started doing some research on this kind of products after having difficulties to both teach, engage my students and wasting time moving from one corner to another in the classroom to get to my laptop and change the slides. At the very beggining, I consider just buying the cheapest product that could achive the same goal: emulate a left or right key press on the system. Yet, by doing so, I also thought that I could do so using any wireless keyboard and/or a mouse. 

That solution did not scrath my itch, and I kept considering a device with other functions. In that process I found two brands: NORWII and Logitech. After more detailed and deep thought, I tailored my options to Logi R500 and the Spotlight (minding the price tag [50 or 100USD]). 

Both options offered similar capabilities when it comes to the software and hardware: 3 buttons and a software to modify and bind different commands to the buttons. The only significant differente was, and maybe the selling point, the presentation features. By this I reffer to the laser pointer and any extra tool to increase the engament in the presentation. 

The R500s comes with a physical laser that under some circustances can help the audience to pay attention to specific details. However, in any bright environment it can be invisible and thus rendering the feature useless.

In contrast, the Spotlight does not have a physical pointer light, but it does include a better tool: mouse-simulation using sensors and a gyroscope. Along with the software, it allows it to perform actions such as moving the coursor, clicking, black screen, amplifier and so more commands (even smart actions).  

## How to set it up

Once you connect the dongle (included) into the computer, open Logi+. By doing so, the system will detect the new device and will start the tutorial for the device. 

More options will be available once the tutorial has finished. Consider adding all possible changes and configurations to the device such as vibration, timers, buttons functions and behaviour. 

Do not forget you can create smart actions (similar to macros) that can be executed with just one button on long press.


## Any trick? 

:::tip
 These suggestions are based on personal experience
:::

1. Use back button to darken the whole screen. If you need to interact with the audience and recall their attention, it is a great idea to turn the screen temporarely. 

2. The most relevant feature is the magnifier. Make sure you can modify the radious it will affect and the overall behaviour of the function. It does wonders once correctly set up. 



## Opinion 

The product is a solid device with plenty of personalization. I cannot be happier when using a device that meets the expectations and offers a great experience. However, it is important to consider that many users online have reported multiple issues, specially when it comes to compatibility. 

If I were to give it a score, I would say it is a 4 stars product. The only main drawback I have found is the relation cost-benefit. I think people can also use any other cheaper device and will have the same basic experience. Nonetheless, expert users or frequent users may find more benefits in using the Spotlight rather than on other similar product.
